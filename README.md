Tinkernut Tutorial - Python Web Scraper with BeautifulSoup library.
Scrapes the HTML from a given web page and stores the text in a CSV file with relevant table row and column headers. 
The CSV file can be opened in Excel for data reporting which makes data gathering a little more efficient. 
BeautifulSoup is an easy library to import although it does have some limitations in terms of the manul searching required. 
I am buidling towards automation with Python which the Scrapy library will be a good shoe-in to automate a web crawler.
